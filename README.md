## Create kickstart disk

Create raw virtual disk using qemu-img.
```bash
qemu-img create -f raw <disk_name> <disk_size>
```

Attach newly created disk to a loop device. (If needed create it before it)
```bash
losetup /dev/loop0 <disk_name>
```

Partition the disk to prepare it for filesystem creation. Accept the defaults.
```bash
fdisk /dev/loop0
```

Create file system and label the disk as ```OEMDRV```. This causes the disk to be automatically searched as a possible location for the kickstart file. During filesystem creation.
```bash
mkfs.ext4 -L OEMDRV /dev/loop0
```

Confirm the label was properly created.
```bash
e2label /dev/loop1
```

Mount the newly formated disk. (Create mount location if necessary)
```bash
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/disk
```

Copy prepared beforehand kickstart file. Red Hat provides a basic configuration tool at https://access.redhat.com/labs/kickstartconfig/ accessible with free developer subscription.
```bash
cp ks.cfg /mnt/disk/
``` 

Unount the the disk and detach it from loop device.
```bash
umount /dev/loop0 /mnt/disk
losetup -d /dev/loop0
```

The disk is ready to be uploaded to the Ovirt Engine. Format of the disk should be specified as raw.

**Note**

The packages chosen in the kickstart file  need to be provided in the selected iso image, otherwise the installator will wait for manual confirmation of installation without required packages.
