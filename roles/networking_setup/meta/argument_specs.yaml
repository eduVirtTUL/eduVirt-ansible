      - Role for configuring the networking of nodes.
      - Configures management network by removing vm traffic, adds storage network to the node and trunkated network for vm's usage.
      - >
        Nodes are taken from [ovirt_nodes] inventory group. Each of the hosts has to have
        [mgmt_mac], [storage_mac], [trunk_mac] specified, which represent respective network interface mac addresses.
      - >
        Additionaly a [storage_ip] and [vm_networks] is needed, [storage_ip] for each of the nodes,
        which represent ip address which should be assigned to the storage interface.
        [vm_networks] for the execution host, a list of pairs of [name]: a string with the name of the name of the network
        and [vlan_tag]: number representing a vlan tag assigned to the network.

      - Requires variables ovirt_admin_username and ovirt_admin_password, used for authentication to ovirt, to be set for host.
